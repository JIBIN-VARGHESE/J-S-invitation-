## 1. Editing wedding details

Open **`config.js`**. It holds the names, dates, times, venues, addresses, map links, the Bible verse, story text, timeline, photo paths, RSVP settings and music.

- If you don't know a value yet, leave it as `""`. The site then shows a quiet line such as *"Church to be announced"* or *"Time to follow"*. It never makes up details.
- Times use 24-hour Kerala time: `"11:00"`, `"16:30"`.
- `wedding.ceremonyTime` also sets the countdown target. Until you set it, the countdown runs to 00:00 IST on 25 April 2027.

**Values still to fill in:** engagement time, venue, address and Maps link (it currently searches for the town). Street addresses for the church and reception (optional; the town is shown instead). RSVP deadline (optional).

**The one exception is the link preview.** WhatsApp and iMessage read the `<meta property="og:…">` tags at the top of `index.html` without running JavaScript, so edit those by hand. After deploying, change `og:image` to the full URL, for example `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/assets/images/og-image.jpg`. Otherwise many apps won't show the image.

## 2. The journey

The page is one continuous scene, run by `assets/js/journey.js`. Scrolling doesn't move content up the page; it moves a camera through a 3D church (`assets/js/nave.js`, WebGL). Everything is placed from **one eased scroll value per frame**, so the church, cards and light never drift apart.

1. **Arrival:** the statue picture and your names, then a fade to black.
2. **The church wakes:** "In the presence of God and our families…", candles light one by one down the aisle, then the windows.
3. **Save the Date** hangs in the air of the aisle; you walk through it.
4. **Stations:** invitation, engagement, ceremony, reception, countdown, RSVP. Each card stands in the aisle. As you reach it, the camera turns to it, it comes to the centre and holds while you read, then you walk on past. The verse appears between the invitation and the engagement, under the brightening rose window.
5. **The light:** at the altar the rose window swells until light fills the screen ("Your presence would make our celebration complete").
6. **Together:** out of the light, the couple photo. It drifts slowly closer, gold dust floats, the names write themselves, the verse and one candle appear.

**Changing the pacing.** At the top of `journey.js`:
- `TOTAL` is the length in screens of scrolling;
- `STATIONS` says where each card stands (`z` along the aisle, `x` left/right) and when it arrives (`a`), holds until (`b`) and is passed (`s1`);
- `CAM` lists the camera's position along the aisle at given scroll points.

Keep the stations and the camera points in step.

**Typing in the reply card** freezes the scene until the keyboard closes, so it never slides away.

**Reduce motion / no JavaScript:** the same scenes stack as a calm page over a still, lit church.

| Layer | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Opening picture | `assets/images/hero/hero-portrait.webp`, `hero-landscape.webp` | a still from the Vecteezy clip you supplied |
| Floor, carpet, walls, side-aisle windows | `floor.webp`, `carpet.webp`, `wall.webp`, `aisle.webp` | rendered for this site; they repeat |
| Pillars, arches, pews | `pier.webp`, `arch.webp`, `pew.webp`, `pewend.webp` | rendered for this site |
| Altar wall (rose window, altar, candles) | `altar.webp` | rendered for this site |
| The couple (finale) | `assets/images/closing/couple-arches.webp` | your AI-generated photo |

All church textures are in `assets/images/nave/`; paths are listed in `config.js → art`. Texture sizes are powers of two (512, 1024, 2048); keep them that way if you replace one.

**Credits.** The footer credit line was removed at your request. The free Vecteezy licence (opening picture) requires visible attribution, so either hold a premium licence or add a credit line back at the end of `index.html`.

## 2b. Animations (Lottie)

The site plays Lottie animations, configured in `config.js → lottie`. The player is `assets/js/vendor/lottie_light.min.js` (lottie-web, MIT licence). It only downloads when the first animation is about to appear on screen.

| Slot | Where | Current file |
|---|---|---|
| `hero` | above the names, plays once | `assets/lottie/rings.json` (gold rings drawing themselves) |
| `countdown` | above "Counting the days" | *(empty)* |
| `rsvp` | plays when a guest sends a reply | `assets/lottie/heart-burst.json` |

The current animations were made for this site. (The dust in the church light is drawn by `nave.js`, not Lottie.) **To use one from LottieFiles:**
1. Open the animation on lottiefiles.com and choose **Download → Lottie JSON**. Don't pick `.lottie`, because this player reads only `.json`.
2. Save the file in `assets/lottie/`, for example `assets/lottie/confetti.json`.
3. Set the slot's `src` to that path. Use `loop: true` for continuous effects (petals, sparkles) and `loop: false` for one-off moments (rings, a heart).
4. Check the animation's licence on its LottieFiles page.

Keep each JSON under about 300 KB, because big animations make phones stutter. Guests who have "reduce motion" turned on see the one-off animations as a still final frame, and the looping ones are hidden.

## 3. Music

Put an MP3 at `assets/music/wedding.mp3`. The music button appears only once that file exists. Music never autoplays: mobile browsers block it, and it's impolite. Guests tap **Music** to start it. Set `music.enabled: false` to remove the button. Only use music you have the right to share.

## 4. Connecting RSVP (all free tiers)

Right now replies are **emailed to jibinv471@gmail.com** through FormSubmit (free, no account):
```js
provider: "formsubmit", endpoint: "jibinv471@gmail.com",
```
**One-time activation:** after the site is live, open it and send one test reply. FormSubmit emails an "Activate Form" link to that address (check spam). Click it; from then on every reply arrives as an email with the name, attending, number of guests and message. Until it is activated, guests see "Something went wrong", so do this before sharing the link. FormSubmit's activation email also offers a random alias you can use instead of the address, so the address isn't visible in the page source.

Other free options, if you'd rather collect replies in a spreadsheet:

**Formspree (easiest).** Sign up at formspree.io, create a form, and copy its endpoint.
```js
provider: "formspree", endpoint: "https://formspree.io/f/abcdwxyz",
```

**Google Sheets via Apps Script (free, replies land in a spreadsheet).**
1. Create a Google Sheet with headers in row 1: `submittedAt | name | attending | guests | message`.
2. Go to Extensions → Apps Script and paste:
   ```js
   function doPost(e) {
     var d = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);
     SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet().appendRow([d.submittedAt, d.name, d.attending, d.guests, d.message]);
     return ContentService.createTextOutput("ok");
   }
   ```
3. Deploy → New deployment → Web app. Set *Execute as: Me* and *Who has access: Anyone*. Copy the URL.
4. In `config.js`: `provider: "appsScript", endpoint: "https://script.google.com/macros/s/…/exec"`.

**Google Forms.** Use `provider: "googleForm"`. The endpoint is the form URL ending in `/formResponse`, and you fill `googleFormFields` with the `entry.NNNN` IDs (find them via the form's "Get pre-filled link"). The browser can't confirm delivery with this method, so test once yourself.

**Supabase / Firebase.** Supported in `assets/js/rsvp.js`. Set `endpoint` (and `key` for Supabase's anon key). Lock the table down with insert-only row-level security.

Every provider is a small function in `assets/js/rsvp.js`. To add a new one, write a function that returns a Promise and reference it by name.

## 5. Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to GitHub. The site files must be at the root of the branch, as they are here.
2. On GitHub, open the repo and go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set *Source* to **Deploy from a branch**, the branch to **`main`** (or whichever branch holds the site), and the folder to **`/ (root)`**. Click **Save**.
4. Wait about 1 minute. The site will be live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/`.
5. Update `og:image` in `index.html` to that absolute URL (see section 1), commit, and push. Pages redeploys automatically on every push.
6. Test the link by sending it to yourself on WhatsApp. If the preview is stale, add `?v=2` to the URL.

The empty `.nojekyll` file tells Pages to serve files as they are. All paths are relative, so the site works under any repo name. A custom domain can be added later under Settings → Pages → Custom domain.

**Preview locally:** run `python3 -m http.server` in this folder and open http://localhost:8000. Opening `index.html` straight from disk mostly works, but a local server is more faithful.

**Before sending the link,** make sure you have:
- filled in `config.js`
- connected RSVP
- set the absolute `og:image` URL
- tested the site on one Android phone and one iPhone

## Design notes

**What was taken from the reference video.** These are interaction ideas only. None of its art, text or branding is used.
- **Opening.** Large tracked capitals for the names float over a sky. On scroll, a monument rises from below, the names recede behind it, and the camera pushes *through* the architecture into the next scene.
- **Architecture as portal.** Every major scene change happens through an arch. The arch frames the invitation copy, and section edges open like doorways.
- **Pacing.** Each scene holds briefly while pinned, then hands over. Long stretches have no motion until the guest scrolls. Scroll position drives most of the motion.
- **Information sections.** Events sit in framed cards with a photograph, title, details and a location button. The countdown uses small tiles on a textured ivory paper. Then comes "Will you join us?" with an RSVP call to action.
- **Closing.** A wide landscape scene is the final, still image.

**Visual system ("walking down the aisle"):**
- **One continuous space.** Every section after the opening film takes place inside the same candle-lit church. Darkness, with light from the windows, candles and stained glass.
- **Story.** The guest walks toward the altar while the couple come together, and the final screen is the two of them hand in hand under the rose window.
- **Type.** Cinzel engraved capitals with Great Vibes script flourishes. Cormorant Garamond for reading, Jost for labels.
- **Colour.** Candle-lit dark, candle gold and cream throughout. No light sections, so the theme never breaks.

**Performance and accessibility.**
- All scroll motion is `transform` and `opacity`, driven by one `requestAnimationFrame` loop. That loop only measures sections currently near the viewport.
- The countdown only ticks while it is on screen.
- Fonts are self-hosted and Latin-subset (about 176 KB total, with the two critical files preloaded). Images lazy-load. There are no libraries.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` collapses the pinned scenes into calm static compositions and removes transitions.
- The lightbox supports Esc, arrow keys, swipe and a focus trap. Form errors are announced with `aria-live`.

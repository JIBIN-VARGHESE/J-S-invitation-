   JIBIN & SOFI — WEDDING CONFIGURATION
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This is the ONLY file you need to edit to change wedding information.

   • Leave a value as "" (empty) when you don't know it yet. The site will
     show a graceful "to be announced" line instead — nothing is invented.
   • Dates use ISO format: "YYYY-MM-DD".  Times use 24h "HH:MM" (Kerala time).
   • Image paths are relative to the site root. To replace an image, either
     overwrite the file with the same name, or change the path here.
   • The only things NOT controlled from here are the link-preview tags
     (WhatsApp / iMessage preview) at the top of index.html — see README.
